Restaurant Page Project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, JavaScript Course, Organizing your JavaScript Code Section, Classes, ES6 Modules and Webpack)

My first project using webpack. This is a restaurant page that uses tabbed browsing to access the Home, Contact and Menu pages. Everything is build with JavaScript DOM Manipulation. Every tab's content is in a separate module and index.js imports all the modules to compile the site structure.
